## Classifier Accuracy
The classifier achieved an accuracy of approximately **0.74** on a separate test set, meaning it correctly classified 74% of the data points, and a **0.72 F1 macro**, indicating a reasonable balance between precision and recall.  

The standard accuracy of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks can vary widely depending on factors such as the complexity of the task or the quality and size of the dataset used for training. For similarly complex tasks such as question answering or natural language inference, accuracies typically range from 70% to 90% (A. Wang et al., 2018). Therefore, the present scores can be considered acceptable
